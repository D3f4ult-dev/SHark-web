                Ever since I was a child, I have been fascinated by computers and programming. The ability to create interactive experiences through coding excites me. I have been designing simple game programs and am currently advancing my skills in JAVA programming, which comes naturally to me. My dream is to become an exceptional programmer who innovates and brings ideas to life.
